This is a dinosaur game made by Meghan Tighe and Rebecca Jordan for Olin's Spring 2015 Software Design course. The interactiveprogrammingproject branch is what we turned in for the class, but we're continuing to work on the game.

Before playing:
-Install Pygame!

To play:
-Right click to create dinosaurs and left click to create humans.
-You may notice that the counter at the top still shows 0 dinosaurs. This is because your dinosaurs are born as babies! The counter only keeps track of the adults. Keep them alive and you will see your babies mature into adults.
-Feed the dinosaurs! If you don't feed them they will die. And that would be sad. You can see the hunger level of each dinosaur in the health bar that travels below it.
-Place the humans strategically. Although dinosaurs are trapped within the window of the game, humans can escape. This means that if you put one by the edge of the screen, he will immediately run to safety and you will have lost a human. Pick wisely.
-See how many dinosaurs you can keep alive and healthy!!
